RStudio is a useful integrated development environment (IDE) that makes it cleaner to write, run and organise R code. Rproj is the file extension for an R project, essentially a working directory marker, shortens file paths, keep everything relevant to your project together and easy to reference. packages are collections of functions written to make specific tasks easier, eg the stringr package contains functions to work with strings. Packages are often referred to as libraries in other programing languages. .R is the file extension for a basic R script in which anything not commented out with # is code that is run. .Rmd is the file extension for Rmarkdown an R package useful for producing reports. A .Rmd script is different to a .R script in that the default is text rather than code. Code is placed in code chunks - similar to how a Jupyter Notebook looks. 2.2 DfT R/RStudio - subject to change Which version of R/RStudio should I use at DfT? A good question. Currently the ‘best’ verion of R we have available on network is linked to RStudio version 11543. This can be accessed via the Citrix app on the Windows 10 devices, or via Citrix desktop. The local version of RStudio on the Windows 10 devices is currently unusable (user testing is ongoing to change this). 2.3 RStudio IDE Whistle stop tour of R favourite IDE - with pics! 2.4 Projects Why you should work in an R project, how to set up and project happiness. 2.4.1 folders data, output, images 2.4.2 sessionInfo() Include a saved file of the sessionInfo() output, this command prints out the versions of all the packages currently loaded. This information is essential when passing on code as packages can be updated and code breaking changes made. 2.5 R memory R works in RAM, so its memory is only as good as the amount of RAM you have 2.6 Vectors 2.6.1 Types There are four main atomic vector types that you are likely to come across when using R1; logical (TRUE or FALSE), double (3.142), integer (2L) and character (&quot;Awesome&quot;) v1 &lt;- TRUE typeof(v1) ## [1] &quot;logical&quot; v1 &lt;- FALSE typeof(v1) ## [1] &quot;logical&quot; v2 &lt;- 1.5 typeof(v2) ## [1] &quot;double&quot; v2 &lt;- 1 typeof(v2) ## [1] &quot;double&quot; # integer values must be followed by an L to be stored as integers v3 &lt;- 2 typeof(v3) ## [1] &quot;double&quot; v3 &lt;- 2L typeof(v3) ## [1] &quot;integer&quot; v4 &lt;- &quot;Awesome&quot; typeof(v4) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; As well as the atomic vector types you will often encounter two other vector types; factor and Date. Factor vectors are used to represent categorical data. They are actually integer vectors with two additional attributes, levels and class. At this stage it is not worth worrying to much about what attribute are just understand that, for factors, the levels attribute gives the possible categories and combined with the integer values works much like a lookup table. The class attribute is just “factor”. ratings &lt;- factor(c(&quot;good&quot;, &quot;bad&quot;, &quot;bad&quot;, &quot;amazing&quot;)) typeof(ratings) ## [1] &quot;integer&quot; attributes(ratings) ## $levels ## [1] &quot;amazing&quot; &quot;bad&quot; &quot;good&quot; ## ## $class ## [1] &quot;factor&quot; Date vectors are just double vectors with an additional class attribute set as “Date”. Note - The following borrows directly from Hadley’s Advanced R site so we need to attribute appropriately and use correct licence today &lt;- Sys.Date() typeof(today) ## [1] &quot;double&quot; attributes(today) ## $class ## [1] &quot;Date&quot; The value of the double (which can be seen by stripping the class), represents the number of days since “1970-01-01”2: date &lt;- as.Date(&quot;1970-02-01&quot;) unclass(date) ## [1] 31 2.6.2 Conversion between atomic vector types Converting between the atomic vector types is done using the as.character, as.integer, as.logical and as.double functions. value &lt;- 1.5 as.integer(value) ## [1] 1 as.character(value) ## [1] &quot;1.5&quot; as.logical(value) ## [1] TRUE Where it is not possible to convert a value you will get a warning message value &lt;- &quot;z&quot; as.integer(value) ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion ## [1] NA When combining different vector types, coercion will obey the following hierarchy: character, double, integer, logical. typeof(c(9.9, 3L, &quot;pop&quot;, TRUE)) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; typeof(c(9.9, 3L, TRUE)) ## [1] &quot;double&quot; typeof(c(3L, TRUE)) ## [1] &quot;integer&quot; typeof(TRUE) ## [1] &quot;logical&quot; technically there are more, see https://adv-r.hadley.nz/vectors-chap.html#atomic-vectors↩ This special date is known as the Unix Epoch↩ "]
