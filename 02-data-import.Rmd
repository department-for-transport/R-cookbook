# Data Importing/Exporting and interaction with other programmes {#data-import}

This chapter is for code examples of data importing/exporting and interactions with other programmes and databases.

## Libraries

```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(DBI)
library(dbplyr)
library(haven)
library(bigrquery)
library(fs)
library(haven)
library(xltabr)
library(openxlsx)
```

## Navigating folders

A couple of pointers to navigate from your working directory, which, if you're using R projects (it is highly recommended that you do) will be wherever the `.Rproj` file is located 

### Down

To navigate down folders use `/`. The path given below saves the file **my_df.csv** in the **data** folder, which itself is inside the **monthly_work** folder
```{r eval=FALSE}
readr::write_csv(
  x = my_dataframe
  , path = "monthly_work/data/my_df.csv"
)
```

### Up

To go up a folder use `../`. In particular you may need to do this when running Rmarkdown files. Rmarkdown files use their location as the working directory. If you have created an **R** folder, say, to stash all your scripts in, and a **data** folder to stash your data files in, then you will need to go up, before going down...

The path below goes up one folder, then into the **data** folder, where the **lookup_table.csv** is located.
```{r eval=FALSE}
lookup_table <- readr::read_csv(
  file = "../data/lookup_table.csv"
)
```

## Working with files in R

This section focusses on reading in various filetypes for working on in R memory. 

### .rds

.rds is R's native file format, any object you create in R can be saved as a .rds file. The functions `readRDS` and `saveRDS` are base R functions.

```{r eval=FALSE}
#not run
saveRDS(
  object = my_model #specify the R object you want to save
  , file = "2019_0418_my_model.rds" #give it a name, don't forget the file extension
)
```


### .csv

We use the functions `read_csv` and `write_csv` from the `readr` package (which is part of the `tidyverse`). These are a little bit *cleverer* than their base counterparts, however, this cleverness can catch you out.

#### `readr::read_csv`

The file **messy_pokemon_data.csv** contains pokemon go captures data which has been deliberately messed up a bit. `read_csv` imputes the column specification from the first 1000 rows, which is fine if your first 1000 rows are representative of the data type. If not then subsequent data that can't be coerced into the imputed data type will be replaced with NA. 

Looking at the column specification below notice that `read_csv` has recognised **time_first_capture** as a time type, but not **date_first_capture** as date type. Given the information that **combat_power** should be numeric we can see that something is also amiss here as `read_csv` has guessed character type for this column.  
```{r}
pokemon <- readr::read_csv(
  file = "data/messy_pokemon_data.csv"
)
```

Let's have a quick look at some data from these columns
```{r}
pokemon %>% 
  dplyr::select(species, combat_power, date_first_capture, time_first_capture) %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(desc(combat_power)) %>% 
  head()
```

The pokemon dataset has less than 1000 rows so `read_csv` has 'seen' the letters mixed in with some of the numbers in the **combat_power** column. It has guessed at character type because everything in the column can be coerced to character type.

What if there are more than 1000 rows? For example, say you have a numeric column, but there are some letters prefixed to the numbers in some of the post-row-1000 rows. These values are still meaningful to you, and with some data wrangling you can extract the actual numbers. Unfortunately `read_csv` has guessed at type double based on the first 1000 rows and since character type cannot be coerced into double, these values will be replaced with `NA`. If you have messy data like this the best thing to do is to force `read_csv` to read in as character type to preserve all values as they appear, you can then sort out the mess yourself.

You can specify the column data type using the `col_types` argument. Below I have used a compact string of abbreviations to specify the column types, see the help at `?read_csv` or the `readr` vignette for the full list. You can see I got many parsing failures, which I can access with `problems()`. This is a data frame of the values that `read_csv` was unable to coerce into the type I specified, and so has replaced with NA. 
```{r}
pokemon <- readr::read_csv(
  file = "data/messy_pokemon_data.csv"
  , col_types = "cdddcdcccDt"
)
# c = character, d = double, D = Date, t = time
```
Let's take a look at the problems.
```{r}
problems(pokemon) %>% 
  head()
```

And since I know that there are problems with **combat_power** let's take a look there.
```{r}
problems(pokemon) %>% 
  dplyr::filter(col == "combat_power") %>% 
  head()
  
```
The `problems()` feature in `read_csv` is super useful, it helps you isolate the problem data so you can fix it.

Other arguments within `read_csv` that I will just mention, with their default settings are

- `col_names = TRUE`: the first row on the imput is used as the column names.
- `na = c("", "NA")`: the default values to interpret as `NA`.
- `trim_ws = TRUE`: by default trims leading/trailing white space. 
- `skip = 0`: number of lines to skip before reading data.
- `guess_max = min(1000, n_max)`: maximum number of records to use for guessing column type. NB the bigger this is the longer it will take to read in the data.

#### `readr::write_csv`

There are many `write_` functions in the `readr` package. I rarely use anything other than `write_csv`, but some are faster or have other functionality. See the full list by running `?write_csv` in the console.

Set the path relative to your R project or working directory, and name the file including the file extension ".csv". Pay attention to the defaults, for instance you might want to change the default `na = "NA"` to `na = ""` so that __NA__'s in your data are written to blanks in your .csv rather than the character string "NA". This is important if "NA" means something else in your data, for example, if you are working with country codes including "NA" for Namibia...

```{r eval=FALSE}
#not run

readr::write_csv(
  x = pokemon
  , path = "data/pokemon.csv"
  , na = "NA" #default - take care if dealing with country code NA for Namibia!
  , append = FALSE #default is not to append, if the file exists it will be overwritten
  , col_names = !append #default is the opposite of append, since if appending you don't want the col_names repeated
  , quote_escape = "double" #default - eg use two types of quote if you want the output quoted; eg "'quoted output'" will be written as 'quoted output'.
)

```





### Importing .xlsx and .xls

Excel workbooks come in many shapes and sizes. You may have one or many worksheets in one or many workbooks, there may only be certain cells that you are interested in. Below are a few examples of how to cope with these variations using `readxl` and `purrr` to iterate over either worksheets and/or workbooks.

#### A single worksheet in a single workbook

The simplest combination, you are interested in one rectangular datset in a particular worksheet in one workbook. Leaving the defaults works fine on this dataset. Note that `readxl::read_excel` detects if the file is `.xlsx` or `.xls` and behaves accordingly.

```{r}
readxl::read_excel(path = "data/port0499.xlsx") %>% 
  head()
```

Let's set a few of the other arguments, run `?read_excel` in the console to see the full list.
```{r}
readxl::read_excel(
  path = "data/port0499.xlsx"
  , sheet = 1 #number or name of sheet, default is first sheet
  , col_names = TRUE #default
  , col_types = "text" #a single type will recycle to all columns, specify each using character vector of the same length eg c("numeric", "text", ...)
) %>% 
  head()
```


#### A single worksheet in many workbooks

For example, you collect pokemon go capture data from many different players, the data all has the same struture and you want to read it in and row bind into a single dataframe in R. 
The code below collects the names of the 3 excel workbooks using `fs::dir_ls`, and, as these are not the only files in that folder, I've specified them using regular expressions (regex). Then we use `purrr::map_df` to iterate over this list of files, applying the function we supply, that is `readxl::read_excel`. The `.id` argument adds the file path into a new column, which we have named "player" in this instance.

```{r}

pokemon <- fs::dir_ls(path = "data", regex = "pokemon_player_.\\.xlsx$")  %>% 
  purrr::map_df(readxl::read_excel, .id = "player")

DT::datatable(data = pokemon)

```

Note that the `regex` argument in `fs::dir_ls` is applied to the full file path so if I had tried to specify that the file name starts with "pokemon" by front anchoring it using "^pokemon" this would return no results, since the full name is actually "data/pokemon...".

[stringr cheatsheet including regex](http://edrub.in/CheatSheets/cheatSheetStringr.pdf)

#### Many worksheets in a single workbook

You have a single workbook, but it contains many worksheets of interest, each containing rectangular data with the same structure. For example, you have a workbook containing pokemon go captures data, where each different data collection point has its own sheet. The data structure, column names and data types are consistent. You want to read in and combine these data into a single dataframe.

The code below sets the location of the workbook and puts this in the object `path`. It then collects the names of all the sheets in that workbook using `readxl::excel_sheets`. Next `purrr::set_names` sets these names in a vector so that they can be used in the next step. This vector of names is implictly assigned to the `.x` argument in `purrr::map_df` as it is the first thing passed to it. This means we can refer to it as `.x` in the function we are iterating, in this case `readxl::read_excel`. Finally, an id column is included, made up of the sheet names and named "sheet". The output is a single dataframe with all the sheets row bound together.

```{r}
path <- "data/multi_tab_messy_pokemon_data.xlsx"

pokemon_collections <- readxl::excel_sheets(path = path) %>% 
  purrr::set_names() %>% 
   purrr::map_df(
     ~ readxl::read_excel(path = path, sheet = .x)
     , .id = "sheet"
   )

DT::datatable(data = pokemon_collections)

```

#### Many worksheets in many workbooks

Now we can use the above two solutions to combine data from many worksheets spread across many workbooks. As before, the data is rectangular and has the same structure. For example, you receive a workbook every month, containing pokemon go captures data, and data collection point has its own sheet. 

We create a function to import and combine the sheets from a single workbook, and then iterate this function over all the workbooks using `purrr::map_df`.

```{r}
#function to combine sheets from a single workbook
read_and_combine_sheets <- function(path){
  readxl::excel_sheets(path = path) %>% 
  purrr::set_names() %>% 
   purrr::map_df(
     ~ readxl::read_excel(path = path, sheet = .x)
     , .id = "sheet"
   )
}

#code to iterate over many workbooks
pokemon_monthly_collections <- fs::dir_ls(
  path = "data", regex = "pokemon_2019\\d{2}\\.xlsx$")  %>% 
  purrr::map_df(
    read_and_combine_sheets
    , .id = "month"
    )

DT::datatable(data = pokemon_monthly_collections)
```

#### Non-rectangular data in many workbooks

You have received some kind of data entry form that has been done in excel in a more human readable, rather than machine readable, format. Some of the cells contain instructions and admin data so you only want the data held in specific cells. This is non-rectangular data, that is, the data of interest is dotted all over the place. In this example we have pet forms, one sheet per workbook, and the data of interest is in cells B2, D5 and E8 only.

Let's see what we get if we naively try to read in one of these forms.
```{r message=FALSE}
readxl::read_excel(
  path = "data/pet_form_1.xlsx"
) %>% 
  head()

```
It's not what we wanted, let's try again, now using the `range` argument
```{r message=FALSE}
readxl::read_excel(
  path = "data/pet_form_1.xlsx"
  , col_names = FALSE
  , range = "A2:B2"
)
```
The `range` argument helps, we have picked up one bit of the data, and it's name. The `range` argument uses the `cellranger` package which allows you to refer to ranges in Excel files in Excel style. However, we have 3 disconnected data points, we need to iterate, so it's `purrr::map_df` to the rescue once more.
```{r}
pet_details <- purrr::map_df(
    .x = c("B2", "D5", "E8")
    , ~ readxl::read_excel(
      path = "data/pet_form_1.xlsx"
      , range = .x
      , col_names = "cells"
      , col_types = "text" #have to use text to preserve all data in single column
    ) 
  ) 
pet_details
```
This is pretty close to what we want, we have a dataframe named `pet_details` comprising a single "cells" column, which contains all the relevant data from this worksheet. Now we can reshape it. Below I create a tibble with the column names I want in the first column, under "cell_name" and pull the data from `pet_details` into it, then spread it.
```{r}
pet <- tibble::tibble(
    cell_name = c("Name", "Age", "Species")
    , values = dplyr::pull(pet_details)
  ) %>% 
    dplyr::mutate(
      cell_name = as_factor(cell_name) #convert to factor to preserve order
      ) %>% 
    tidyr::spread(
      key = cell_name #make variable name the key and the values the value
      , value = values
      )
pet
```
Having solved for one workbook and sheet, we can functionalise and iterate to gather the data from every wookbook. (Note if you have many worksheets as well, you'll need another interim iteratative step)

The function `get_cells_and_reshape` below iterates over reading each of the three cells from the worksheet, combines these into a single column dataframe, then adds the cell names and reshapes the data into tidy format. It takes three inputs, `path`, `cells`, `cell_name`, all of which are type character or character vector.
```{r}
get_cells_and_reshape <- function(path, cells, cell_name){
  purrr::map_df(
    .x = cells
    , ~ readxl::read_excel(
      path = path
      , range = .x
      , col_names = "details"
      , col_types = "text" #have to use text to preserve all data in single column
    ) 
  ) %>% 
  dplyr::pull() %>% #pull just the values from the previous df
  tibble::tibble( #create df with 2 columns, cell_name and these values
    cell_name = c("Name", "Age", "Species")
    , values = . #use . to refer to what was piped, when not in first position
  ) %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(
    cell_name = as_factor(cell_name) #convert to factor to preserve order
  ) %>% 
  tidyr::spread( #this is 
    key = cell_name #make variable name the key and the values the value
    , value = values
  )  
}
```

Let's test it on the first pet form data, first setting the paramaters to use in the function. 
```{r}
path <- "data/pet_form_1.xlsx"
cells <- c("B2", "D5", "E8")
cell_name <- c("Name", "Age", "Species")

get_cells_and_reshape(
  path = path, cells = cells, cell_name = cell_name)
```

It works! So now we can iterate this over all the pet form workbooks, specifying the paths using regex as before. Note we use `.x` in the `path` argument in the `get_cells_and_reshape` function to refer to the vector of paths piped to `purrr::map_df` from `fs::dir_ls`. 
```{r}
fs::dir_ls(
  path = "data", regex = "pet_form_\\d\\.xlsx$")  %>% 
  purrr::map_df(
    ~ get_cells_and_reshape(path = .x, cells = cells, cell_name = cell_name)
    , .id = "path"
    )
```

### Exporting to .xlsx

We recommend `openxlsx` and `xltabr` for writing and formatting tables to MS Excel. The latter is a wrapper built on `openxlsx` developed by MoJ and is specifically aimed at making it easier to produce publication ready tables. `xltabr` has one known drawback in that it applies the foramtting cell by cell, so if your tables are massive (~100,000 rows) it will take too long, in this instance you should resort to `openxlsx`.

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/openxlsx/openxlsx.pdf

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xltabr/xltabr.pdf

Here I am going to go over a few basics of using `xltabr` to produce publication ready output. I'm using an extract of some already published Search and Rescue Helicopter data that was itself produced using `xltabr`, see the full series here. 

https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/search-and-rescue-helicopter-sarh01

#### Formatting prep

I'm assuming that the data has already been cleaned, tidied and the unformatted table created in R, most likely using `reshape2::dcast` (see chapter 4) as `xltabr` has bee designed to work well with `reshape2`. 

Read in table to be formatted

```{r message=FALSE}
demo_sarh <- readr::read_csv(
  file = "data/sarh_example.csv"
)
```

The formatting uses a style sheet for reference. This must be created in a .xlsx workbook, and the specific formatting applied to each cell. The cell text will be the name used to reference that style in the code. In the example below anything with style *header* applied to it will be bold, left-justified, and use the same font style, colour and size as in cell A1. It will also apply the row height, but this can be overwritten. You can also apply cell borders, as in styles *top_header_1*, *top_header_2* and *body_bold_method_change*.
