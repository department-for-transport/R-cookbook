# Load example data for Road Casualties in Great Britain 1969-84

# Look at the data

  # Add rows for dplyr example

# Why do we need _another_ book?

`R` is a very flexible programming language, which inevitably means there are lots of ways to achieve the same result. This is true of all programming languages, but is particularly exaggerated in `R` which makes use of ['meta-programming'](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/). 

For example, here is how to calculate a new variable using standard R and filter on a variable:
```{r}
# Calculate kilometers per litre from miles per gallon
mtcars$kpl <- mtcars$mpg * 0.425144

# Select cars with a horsepower greater than 250 & show only mpg and kpl columns
mtcars[mtcars$hp > 250, c("car", "mpg", "kpl")]

```

Here's the same thing using {tidyverse} style R:
```{r}

mtcars %>%
  # Calculate kilometers per litre
  dplyr::mutate(
    kpl = mpg * 0.425144
  ) %>%
  # Filter cars with a horsepower greater than 250
  dplyr::filter(
    hp > 250
  ) %>%
  # Take only the car, mpg, and newly created kpl columns
  dplyr::select(car, mpg, kpl)
```

These coding styles are quite different. As people write more code across the Department, it will become increasingly important that code can be handed over to other R users. It is much easier to pick up code written by others if it uses the same coding style you are familiar with. 

This is the main motivation for this book, to establish a way of coding that represents a sensible default for those who are new to R that is readily transferable across DfT. 


## Coding standards

Related to this, the Data Science team maintain a [coding standards document](https://department-for-transport.github.io/ds-processes/Coding_standards/r.html), that outlines some best practices when writing R code. This is not prescriptive and goes beyond the scope of this document, but might be useful for managing your R projects. 

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), "bookdown", "knitr", "rmarkdown"
), "packages.bib")
```


## Data

The data used in this book is all derived from opensource data. As well as being availble fro the data folder on the github site [here](https://github.com/departmentfortransport/R-cookbook/tree/master/data) you can also find the larger data sets at the links below.

- [Road Safety Data](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/cb7ae6f0-4be6-4935-9277-47e5ce24a11f/road-safety-data)
- Search and Rescue Helicopter data; SARH0112 record level data download available under **All data** at the bottom of this [webpage](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/search-and-rescue-helicopter-sarh01).
- Pokemon data, not sure of original source, but borrowed from Matt Dray [here](https://github.com/matt-dray/beginner-r-feat-pkmn/tree/master/data)
- Port data; the port data can be downloaded by clicking on the table named [PORT0499](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/port-and-domestic-waterborne-freight-statistics-port)


## Work in progress

This book is not static - new chapters can be added and current chapters can be amended. Please let us know if you have suggestions by raising an issue [here](https://github.com/department-for-transport/R-cookbook/issues).
