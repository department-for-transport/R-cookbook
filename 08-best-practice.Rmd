## What

This sub-chapter explains what a RAP project is using RAP levels amended from NHS Scotland RAP levels.

Use the DfT RAP levels to ensure your DfT RAP project includes everything it should. A project is considered a RAP project at level 4a and above. 

These RAP levels have been amended from the original [NHS Scotland RAP levels](https://www.isdscotland.org/About-ISD/Methodologies/_docs/Reproducible_Analytical_Pipelines_paper_v1.4.pdf) to reflect DfT processes and software capabilities. There is guidance for the descriptors below the RAP levels.
