# Functions {#functions}

```{r include=FALSE}
# Every file must contain at least one R chunk due to the linting process.
```

## User defined functions (UDFs)

A non-exhaustive list of possible reasons for writing your own UDF,
- you are repeating some code chunk changing only a few variables each time.
- you want to apply the same set of commands to multiple instances of some object: it might be a dataframe, a text string, a document, an image etc.
- tidier code, you can write the functions in a separate R file and load these functions by running that file when you load other packages.
- easier to update, just update the function rather than edit potentially multiple code chunks.
- you are writing a package/library
