# Code efficiency and speed {#efficiency}

This chapter discusses the basics of how to optimise your R code so that it runs efficiently and quickly. Some of the major drawbacks of coding in R are the slow speed of the code, and its heavy use of RAM, but writing appropriate code can mitigate these drawbacks for all but the most complex processes.

## Checking code speed
## Storing data in efficient files; CSV, rda, etc
## Sensible package selection e.g. data.table for >100,000 rows
## Limiting number of large objects created
## Storing files in hard memory, not RAM
## Improving processing efficiency with functions
